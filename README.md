After cloning the repository, open the "source" folder in QT Creator and select "ShineCafe.pro" to open our project. You will need to update the file paths for the following .cpp files in your project to reflect their locations on your local machine:

add_waiter.cpp
admin_management.cpp
admin_page.cpp
mainwindow.cpp
order.cpp
remove_waiter.cpp
table.cpp
waiter_page.cpp

You should replace the database and image paths in these files with the correct paths on your computer. Here are the details:
Database holding Waiter information --> ShineCafe.db
Database holding Menu information --> dataBaseMenu.db
Database holding Order information --> Orders.db

Once you have updated the paths correctly, your project should work successfully. For the admin login, there is a default username and password:
Username: nurevsan
Password: 1234

For the waiter login, you should use the information stored in ShineCafe.db:
Example:
Username: ays
Password: 20

After logging in with any user, you can perform the desired tasks.

All group members contributed the project equallly.
